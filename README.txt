This is class project in which we implemented multiple variations of the KNN algorithm and checked the various performance measures using formulas and graphs.

The variations are as follows: 
- Brute-force KNN
- Weighted KNN
- KNN using manhattan distance 
- KNN using euclidean distance 
- KNN standardized and unstandardized

We then evaluated the models using s-fold/ k-fold cross validation and performance measures to find the optimal model. 
The optimal threshold for the ROC and precision-recall curve were determined, along with the confidence interval and generalization error.
